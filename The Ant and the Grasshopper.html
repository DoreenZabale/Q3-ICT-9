<p align="center"><font face="Georgia" color="green" size="14"><u>One bright day in late autumn,</u></font> 
<font face="Georgia" font size="12"> a family of </font> <font face="Georgia" color="purple" size="14"><b>Ants </b></font> 
<font face="Georgia" font size="12">were bustling about <font face="Georgia" color="green" size="14"><u>in the warm sunshine</u></font>, 
drying out the grain they had stored up during the summer, when a starving <font face="Georgia" color="purple" size="14"><b>Grasshopper</b></font>, his 
fiddle under his arm, came up and humbly begged for a bite to eat.</font> <font face="Georgia" color="red" size="14"><sup>"What!" 
cried the <font face="Georgia" color="purple" size="14"><b>Ants</b></font> in surprise, 
"haven't you stored anything away for the winter? What in the world were you doing all last summer?"</sup></font> 
<font face="Georgia" font size="12">"I 
didn't have time to store up any food," whined the <font face="Georgia" color="purple" size="14"><b>Grasshopper</b></font>; "I was so busy making music that before I 
knew it the summer was gone." The <font face="Georgia" color="purple" size="14"><b>Ants</b></font> shrugged their shoulders in disgust. "Making music, were you?" 
they cried.</font> <font face="Georgia" color="blue" font size="14"><sub> "Very well; now dance!" And they turned their backs on the 
<font face="Georgia" color="purple" size="14"><b>Grasshopper</b></font> 
and went on with their work.</sub></font><p>
